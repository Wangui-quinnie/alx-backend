PAGINATION

Paginating a dataset typically involves breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks, often for displaying purposes in a user interface or for efficiently processing large amounts of data. There are several approaches to pagination, depending on the specific requirements of your application. Let's address each of the scenarios you mentioned:

1. Paginating a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters:
In this scenario, you have a dataset that you want to paginate using simple parameters such as page and page_size. Here's a basic approach:

def paginate_dataset(dataset, page, page_size):
    start_index = (page - 1) * page_size
    end_index = start_index + page_size
    return dataset[start_index:end_index]

# Example usage:
dataset = [...]  # Your dataset
page = 2
page_size = 10
result = paginate_dataset(dataset, page, page_size)
print(result)
2. Paginating a dataset with hypermedia metadata:
Hypermedia-driven pagination involves including metadata in the response that provides links or information about navigating through the paginated data. This can be useful for clients to understand how to retrieve the next or previous pages. Here's a basic example:


{
  "data": [...],  // Paginated data
  "metadata": {
    "page": 2,
    "page_size": 10,
    "total_items": 100,
    "next_page": "/api/data?page=3&page_size=10",
    "prev_page": "/api/data?page=1&page_size=10"
  }
}
3. Paginating in a deletion-resilient manner:
When paginating data in a deletion-resilient manner, you need to ensure that if items are deleted while paginating, the pagination remains consistent and items aren't skipped or duplicated. One common approach is to use a cursor-based pagination technique where a cursor is used to track the current position in the dataset. Here's a basic example:

def paginate_with_cursor(dataset, cursor, page_size):
    start_index = dataset.index(cursor)
    end_index = start_index + page_size
    return dataset[start_index:end_index], dataset[end_index]

# Example usage:
dataset = [...]  # Your dataset
cursor = None  # Initial cursor
page_size = 10
result, next_cursor = paginate_with_cursor(dataset, cursor, page_size)
print(result)
In this example, the cursor represents the last item fetched in the previous page. The next_cursor returned from the pagination function can be used as the cursor for fetching the next page.
