Back-end

A caching system is a mechanism used in computing to temporarily store frequently accessed data in a faster and more accessible location, typically closer to the consumer, to improve performance and reduce latency. The cached data is stored in memory or on disk and can be quickly retrieved when requested, reducing the need to fetch the data from its original source.

FIFO (First-In, First-Out): FIFO is a caching algorithm that evicts the oldest (first-in) cached items first when the cache reaches its capacity limit. It operates based on the principle that the items that were cached earliest are the least likely to be needed in the near future.

LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): LIFO is a caching algorithm that evicts the newest (last-in) cached items first when the cache reaches its capacity limit. It operates based on the principle that the items that were cached most recently are the most likely to be needed in the near future.

LRU (Least Recently Used): LRU is a caching algorithm that evicts the least recently accessed items first when the cache reaches its capacity limit. It operates based on the principle that items that have not been accessed recently are less likely to be needed soon.

MRU (Most Recently Used): MRU is a caching algorithm that evicts the most recently accessed items first when the cache reaches its capacity limit. It operates based on the principle that items that have been accessed recently are more likely to be needed soon.

LFU (Least Frequently Used): LFU is a caching algorithm that evicts the least frequently accessed items first when the cache reaches its capacity limit. It operates based on the principle that items that are accessed less frequently are less likely to be needed soon.

The purpose of a caching system is to improve system performance by reducing the time and resources required to access frequently used data. By storing frequently accessed data closer to the consumer, caching systems can reduce latency and improve response times for applications and services.

However, caching systems also have limitations:

Cache Size: Caching systems have a finite capacity, meaning they can only store a certain amount of data at a given time. When the cache reaches its capacity limit, eviction policies determine which items to remove from the cache to make room for new items.

Cache Coherency: Caching systems must ensure that the cached data remains consistent with the original data source. This can be challenging in distributed environments where multiple cache instances are used or when the original data is updated frequently.

Cache Invalidation: Caching systems must handle cache invalidation, which involves removing or updating cached data when it becomes stale or outdated. This process ensures that consumers always receive up-to-date information from the cache.

Cache Consistency: Caching systems must maintain consistency across multiple cache instances to prevent inconsistencies or conflicts between cached data. This is particularly important in distributed or clustered caching environments.

Overall, while caching systems offer significant performance benefits, they require careful management and consideration of their limitations to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
