 Running a Redis Server on Your Machine:
Download and install Redis from the official website or using a package manager.
Start the Redis server by running redis-server in your terminal.
Verify that Redis is running by executing redis-cli ping which should return "PONG".
2. Running Simple Operations with the Redis Client:
Use redis-cli to interact with Redis. Example commands include SET, GET, HSET, HGET, LPUSH, LPOP, etc.
3. Using a Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations:
Install the redis package using npm: npm install redis.
In your Node.js code, require the redis module and create a client using redis.createClient().
Use the client to perform operations like set, get, hset, hget, etc.
4. Storing Hash Values in Redis:
Use the HSET command to store hash values in Redis.
In Node.js, use the hset method provided by the Redis client.
5. Dealing with Async Operations with Redis:
Use Promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js.
Most Redis operations are non-blocking and can be easily wrapped in Promises or used with async/await.
6. Using Kue as a Queue System:
Install the kue package using npm: npm install kue.
Configure Kue and create jobs using createJob().
Process jobs using workers with process() method.
7. Building a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server:
Set up an Express.js project.
Use the express and redis packages.
Create routes to perform Redis operations like GET, POST, etc.
8. Building a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server and Queue:
Follow steps from the previous point.
Integrate Kue into your Express app to handle queuing tasks.
Create routes to add jobs to the queue and process them asynchronously.
